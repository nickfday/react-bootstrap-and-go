React Web App is a simple web starter kit using react-create-app with bootstrap 4 beta and a number of react components to give a comfortable starting point.

This aims to save developers time when they wish to quickly spin-up a web app and get to work rather than have to carry out the repetitive chore of setting up. This can obviously be forked and customised to the developers requirements.

It can be used as an example of how to consume components and give developers new to react a stepping stone so they don't give up before they have started.

At time of writing it is simply a web app with a Bootstrap v4 beta theme and navigable using React Router v4. In the near future I plan to add a basic blog component fed by a restful API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
